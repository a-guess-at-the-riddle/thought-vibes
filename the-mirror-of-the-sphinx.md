I**magine** finding yourself **as** **a dream**— _not_ in a dream so perfectly illusory that you believe it _to_ _be_ _actual reality_, and _not_ asleep inside a _lucid dream_ (i.e., somewhat aware and ego-centered inside the dream you are dreaming), but rather the dream exists on the edge of indefinite qualia-noise and a fully unconscious deep sleep. On occasion you catch fleeting glimpses of a flickering awareness. Still our degenerated dream is primarily, in the limit, one of _“reality undifferentiated from irreality”_ and “_self_ _undifferentiated from non-self_”.

“a state of mind in which something is present, without compulsion and without reason, called 𝐹𝑒𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑔” (Peirce. “What is a Sign”, Essential Peirce Vol II)

Colors, shadows, sounds and feelings flash before you from nothingness only to then quickly disappear, presented vaguely once and forgotten — if one even could characterize such a state, we might described it as static noise, a timeless bubbling, or an insignificant changeless change. Is this state the path out is not apparent, in any case how then does one awaken?

By a crystal-gravity birth, cluster-by-cluster, and further organizing strata through a series of accelerating reverse bifurcations, noise falls into an order as the dream warps and coalesces.

Out of the holographic dream, a perspective bubble blooms forth passing from homogeneous noise piece by piece from turning “_kaleidoscope-objects_” into a crystalized reality.

Slowly awakening bit by bit, you wonder, “_now, how much time has passed you by in this dream, whole eons? or only seconds?_”

We might describe the self by its singularity locus of self & the perceptive bubble of an event horizon of consciousness. You find your dream an alter-reality composed of a near-perfect white floor, an uninformative white firmament, and two duplicate objects. For our exploration in what follows to be more simple let us assume as well that what would be your body is invisible to yourself in such a dream.

Everything seems perfectly hyper-defined, homogeneous, linear and sharp. Ironically now in an ordered environment and now with some capacity of a working memory, memory doesn’t amount to much value as there is hardly anything on which one can ‘reflect’ one’s memories and hone in on some unknown difference (“_a difference that makes a difference_”).

Bored with the room you turn to its only objects, its _riddle_ presents itself to you in the form of two uncanny mirrors.

Their image is one of an infinite hallway of mirror within mirror receding from you into the distance. Though eventually they converge at a point some distance above the center horizontal due to a slight differential in their height above the ground on which they are held.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*B_lFp8H8OfncU0HZpKmy2w.gif)

Now, atop each mirror’s dark metal frame alongside its baroque ornament you see a metallic sculpture of a winged Sphinx along with her inscription:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*r1kF7nGvztXPZCwCw6raYQ.png)

> mirror’d mirrors on the wall  
> how endless is your self-same  
> hall whose entrance I do not recall  
> whose meanings seem as to be our all

> golden spiral, pentagram  
> harmonic trap in which I stand  
> running from that which I am  
> a gravity of hologram

❧ 𝚝𝚑𝚎 𝚙𝚑𝚊𝚗𝚎𝚛𝚘𝚗 𝚎𝚡𝚙𝚎𝚛𝚒𝚖𝚎𝚗𝚝 ❧

Standing equal distance from each mirror and beginning with your gaze directed directly downwards at where your feet would normally be visible, you very slowly raise your line of sight.

Now your former dream mode was one of utter unawareness — essentially _you_ **_were_** _the dream world._ Other than the mirrors, the rest of the room contains no stimulation, so by comparison the _mirror’s edge_ threshold seems a kind of attentional event horizon.

The meaning gradient provides just enough alterity pressure to surface your ego so as to interpret the mirror as an object. But it is a peculiar object for inside it is a scaled perfect icon of itself.

In this context’s “_worldview”_ which most might describe as emphasizing reality’s _actuality_ you are semiotically closed, unaware of unintention — intention contextual fecundity (?error and emergence?).

Passing over the mirror’s threshold we imagine that your perspective falls into its Mercurial glass Matrix as if in an _interpretative trance-like_ state.

Your awareness increases as you become suspicious that you are inhabiting a dream, but the mirror’s spiral re-centering momentum entrains all attention such that you cannot seem to reverse your interpretation’s recurring direction. Soon you feel yourself forgetting just how you arrived here, frantically seeking to find a way back, but the dual mirror hallway leaves you so lost deep inside. Given you had not never have counted every portal of interpretation, which mirror is the real mirror isn’t clear.

Your entrance forgotten, you find your awareness to be drained still further falling into amnesia’s possession. Have you always inhabited this hall?

What was described as “outside the outside” soon becomes only “the outside” soon becomes only “now”. No longer a virtual hall of mirrors but a seemingly real hall of doorways. “_mirr-or_… _mirr_… _What’s a mirror_?”

Your world has become **_fully_** **_enveloped_** inside your reflective interpretation, dually your **_consciousness_** has become fully enveloped inside _an illusion.  
a dream within a dream_.

C. S. Peirce defines the _phaneron_ as _“whatever is present at any time to the mind in any way_”. With your awareness and attention bound to this dream world, is it possible that one can journey through a dream-prison until the iterative interpretation limit converges upon some lesson to be learned?

of your dreaming self and so your dream’s world.

You switch focus from the mirror to the limit point and then further to the mirror medium. Further still you switch your focus to the you who is interpolating those two.

The precision of your focusing attention pulls the _zero dimensional_ vanishing point,…

No longer are you, as if lost inside a hall of mirrors, but the two dreams — the dream and the interpretation captured dream collapse.

but instead presuppose “_a hall of mirrors_” and its asymptotic interpretative reflection (chain of interpretations), but just the one point. From that point _is seems easier_ (_?_) to shift then into perceiving the mirror as a flat normal mirror (_or at least easier than before_). _If it is easier,_ it suggests something about its function as affording a mediating perspective.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*B-YAeoGLgq7txo4TuTP3zA.gif)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*zfSH-JHP82rs_9ouCI7A-Q.gif)

Given that the object of your perception seems a singularity monadic object standing for by its function a triadic relation (vanishing point), the reason that the perspective to point collapse affords mediation is that your awareness of the degree of difference between the perspectives is altered when you abstract from the mirror sequence to the convergent limit (asymptotic reasoning) and the limit is the mediating point and the point is coplanar with the mirror of the flat mirror perspective (a mediating term?). Your interpretation of the nested perspective and your interpretation of the flat mirror become, from the perspective of the vanishing point, one and the same interpretation. One adjustment to our thought experiment might be to alter this metaphor of an essentially ‘perfect’ mirror by assuming only a partially reflective mirror (like e.g. window glass that is especially reflective).

Associations here can be made to many topics and subjects:

‘_theory of mind_’; speech act theory; social ontology; hermeneutics (_interpretation_); evolutionary dynamics & transitions (emergence of new units of selection in biological evolution); major transitions in political order; interactive epistemology (iterated knowledge); semiosis (incl. threeing);

#### Mathematical Analogies

Let’s draw an analogy to the concept of _convergent series_ from mathematics and its formulation in terms of its definition as _a sequence whose partial sums tends to a limit._

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*35R4BxSPAjA3ezdQfLAFgQ.png)

… A Conception of Limits (DOVER)

a series;  
partial sum;  
limit;  
convergence;  
taking a limit, mathematical induction, asymptotic reasoning;

In the context of communication we might conceptualize the dynamics of coming to the same meanings as sequences of reflexive or circuitous interpretative depth and the question of their limit & convergence or divergence. For example notions such as:

— my intended meaning;  
 — my statement (utterance);  
 — your interpretation of my statement;  
 — my interpreted expectation of your future interpretation   
 — my statement (utterance) having (qualitatively) averaged my guess _re._ your likely interpretation into my intended meaning (for rhetorical/mnemonic purposes, i.e. for more harmonious inter-interpretation)  
 — etc…

**i**₁;  
**i**₂ _of_ **i**₁;  
**i**₃ _of_ **i**₂ _of_ **i**₁;  
**i**₄ _of_ **i**₃ _of_ **i**₂ _of_ **i**₁;  
…

But now what about further structural analogies?

#### **Ratio** 

> “In mathematics, a **ratio** shows **how many times one number contains another**. For example, if there are eight oranges and six lemons in a bowl of fruit, then the ratio of oranges to lemons is eight to six (that is, 8:6, which is equivalent to the ratio 4:3). Similarly, the ratio of lemons to oranges is 6:8 (or 3:4) and the ratio of oranges to the total amount of fruit is 8:14 (or 4:7).” — **_Wikipedia. “Ratio”_**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ctdsT7tntRhAA0YXwNZDYg.jpeg)

> **_“_**_The_ **_ratio_** _of two numbers_ **r** _and_ **s** _is written_ **r / s** _where_ **r** _is the numerator and_ **s** _is the denominator. The ratio of_ **r / s** _is equivalent to the quotient_ **r / s**_. Betting odds written as_ **r : s** _correspond to_ **s / (r + s)**_._**_”_** — **_MathWorld. “Ratio”._** _\[_[link](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Ratio.html)_\]_

_form, content, context._  
The usage of the pie chart in arithmetic pedagogy (i.e. for teaching fractions) illustrates the qualitative (connotative) difference between the numerator and denominator of a fraction. In concrete contexts a pie chart depicts a form (the pie chart representational system), a context (what is signified by full pie) and content (the selected slices).

_semiotics._  
With the aid of this quantitative notion of ratio can we then conceptualize a notion of a ratio that is **qualitative**? To first establish some basic semiotic distinctions look over these diagrams from Terrence Deacon’s _Symbolic Species_ regarding C. S. Peirce’s taxonomy of signs (**icon**, **index**, **symbol**).

When we interpret an **icon** we are interpreting it through a lens of the icons familiar to us. Any feeling might be conceptualized as occurring in an **iconic field** with a unrepresented proto-iconic vortical locus. In this sense the feeling is a comparison or a subjective ratio between two tones that we would perceptively tokenize as the same token, all conceived of as the same feeling (singularity). Once the context is well formed enough we name such a singularity as the index (token) for that class.

Our ideas must weigh our observations and convey them into relevant data._

> “Perhaps the most precious possession of man is his abiding awareness of the Analogy of Proper Proportionality, the key to all metaphysical insight, and perhaps the very condition of consciousness itself. This analogical awareness is constituted of a perpetual play of ratios among ratios. **A** is to **B**, what **C** is to **D**, which is to say the ratio between **A** and **B**, is proportionable to the ratio between **C** and **D**, there being a ratio between these ratios, as well, this lively awareness of the most exquisite delicacy depends upon there being no connection whatsoever between the components. If **A** were linked to **B**, or **C** to **D**, mere logic would take the place of analogical perception, thus one of the penalties paid for literacy and a high visual culture is a strong tendency to encounter all things through a rigorous storyline, as it were. Paradoxically, connected spaces and situations exclude participation, whereas discontinuity affords room for involvement. Visual space is connected and creates detachment or non-involvement. It also tends to exclude the participation of the other senses.” — **Marshall McLuhan**, **Through the Vanishing Point** (1968)

But now “_a sign_ (\[**sign relation**\]) _is what every object presupposes_”.

In Peircean semiotics a central notion is that of the triadic sign relation which relates a _sign_, _object_, and _interpretant_. The interpretant itself being another sign. Semiosis, ‘the action of signs’, can be then conceptualized as a dynamic process for which we can speak of a **_sign_**, and both an _immediate_ and _dynamical_ **_object_** and also an _immediate, dynamical_ and _final_ **_interpretant_**.

So the **singular** point in the mirror that is the vanishing point mediates between the hall of mirrors infinite sequence of (nested **triadic**) interpretation and our flat interpretation of the mirror as a **dyadic** object.

> _“Because horizon is the end of vision, and because every move we make gives the field an aspect we couldn’t have noticed before, what lies beyond the horizon cannot be known. (Otherwise it would be within the horizon.) As with the angelic messenger, there is no control over what comes into our vision… There are experiences and new information that will show the familiar as strange the comforting as dangerous, the adjacent as distant. Moreover, not every shift of the viewer will reveal something significant. It can be just more of the same, or nothing worth reflecting on. And yet without that shift, we begin to lose our vision altogether: what is seen over and over again ceases to be seen. What doesn’t appear in a fresh way will be thought changeless and ordinary, no longer a stimulus to thought. Learning is reduced to mere repetition and can only confirm what has already been known. Friendships become static, empty of expectations of the future. The outcome of all our efforts become predictable. All mysteries can be explained. All dimensions and measurements hold. To be aware of our horizons is to live in 𝕨𝕠𝕟𝕕𝕖𝕣.”―_ **James P. Carse, _The Religious Case Against Belief_**

Let’s label our mirrors mirrors Aₘ and Bₘ. Secondly lets employ “_a_” and “_b_” as labels for our indices of the mirror’s doorways:

Aₘ : _a_₁, _a_₁+ _a_₂, _a_₁+ _a_₂+ _a_₃, …  
Bₘ : _b_₁, _b_₁+ _b_₂, _b_₁+ _b_₂+ _b_₃, …

Given our knowledge we origin of each nested mirror is the ‘other’ mirror we can oscillate our descriptive labeling as an interleaving:

Aₘ + Bₘ = Iₘ

_a_₁, _a_₁+ _a_₂, _a_₁+ _a_₂+ _a_₃, … , _b_₁_, b_₁ **\+** _b_₂, _b_₁+ _b_₂+ _b_₃, … = _a_₁, _a_₁+ _b_₁, _a_₁+ _b_₁ + _a_₂, _a_₁+ _b_₁ + _a_₂ + _b_₂ …

and once we have awareness of this embedding notion we might treat the mirrors differently by separating them out.

_a_₁, _a_₁+ _b_₁, _a_₁+ _b_₁ + _a_₂, _a_₁+ _b_₁ + _a_₂ + _b_₂ …  
**⟶  
**_a_₁, _a_₁+ _a_₂, _a_₁+ _a_₂+ _a_₃, …, _b_₁, _b_₁+ _b_₂, _b_₁+ _b_₂+ _b_₃ …

Now an oscillating gravity of attention across these complementary spiral might be viewed as an undulation of attention in the direction of the spiral-dimension.

_(a speculative re-mapping onto the context of a more general archetypal dynamics)_

The \[**_archetypes_**\] of **\[_vorticity_**\], \[**_dynamic undulations_**\], and \[**_compression (divergence)_**\] are distortions of a single \[**_embryonic medium_**\] that permeates the \[**_archetypal_**\] universe and comprises the fabric of \[???\]. Vorticity in this \[**_medium_**\] gives rise to \[**_iconic fields_**\]. Dynamic undulations give rise to \[**_indexical networks_**\]. Compression or divergence gives rise to \[**_symbolic fields_**\]. When put into mathematical form, these relations reveal how vorticity and dynamic undulation can be arranged to produce artificial distortions of the underlying \[(embryonic) medium\] and thus further give rise to possibility of portal-like phenomena.

What are portals when appropriated to a more general context than physics?
